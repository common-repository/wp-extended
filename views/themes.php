<p>XT Themes, a simple way to create themes for wordpress... OK OK OK we are still working on it!<!-- We know that Frameworks are all rage but they not always necessary and somtimes mask simple problems, not providing a solution but a plaster. When we took a second look at the WP theme design workflow we just could not understand why themes were still being divided into parts and re-assembled header, footer, index all separate files, so we figured that there must be a simple way to improve the workflow!</p>
<p>So we looked around at some other layout solutions and liked the one use in <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/CompositeView.html" target="_blank">Zend Layouts</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>There are two design patterns that Zend Framework uses to implement layouts: <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/twoStepView.html" target="_blank">Two Step View</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/CompositeView.html" target="_blank">Composite View</a>. Two Step View is usually associated with the <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/transformView.html" target="_blank">Transform View</a> pattern; the basic idea is that your application view creates a representation that is then injected into the master view for final transformation. The Composite View pattern deals with a view made of one or more atomic, application views.</em></p>
  <p><em>In Zend Framework, <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.layout.html" target="_blank">Zend_Layout</a> combines the ideas behind these patterns. Instead of each action view script needing to include site-wide artifacts, they can simply focus on their own responsibilities.</em></p>

So the solution, attempt to replicate a similar concept in wordpress to zend, </p>
